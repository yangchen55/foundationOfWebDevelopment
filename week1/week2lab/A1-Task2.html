        <p> second place sits Broome's Cable Beach in Western Australia. First time visitors are regularly speechless when they try to describe its beauty and it's not hard to see why. Although slowly gaining in commercialism due to rave reviews and Instagram, Cable Beach is famous for its untouched stretch of shoreline and its inspiring sunsets. Unlike other beaches on this list, Cable Beach sits on the Indian Ocean rather than the Pacific and orange hued sunsets are the subject of many photographers' works.</p>

Burleigh Beach gives off a tropical vibe that is warmly embraced by the locals. On any given day of the year, the heavily patrolled beach and parklands are busy with families and swimmers enjoying the simple pleasures of a day at the beach.</p>

       <p>
           Noosa Main Beach is the standout among the many breathtaking beaches on the Sunshine Coast. The golden sands, pristine waters and patrolled beach make it an ideal swimming spot for the whole family. Pods of dolphins may even join you in the waters and humpback whales can be spotted into the distance during their annual migration. Noosa's north-facing direction means that conditions are far more sheltered than other beaches and the warm climate makes it a lively hub that can be enjoyed year round.
